<h2>What is FCFBValues?</h2>
    <p>FCFBValues is, in essence, a quiz that attempts to assign percentages for different values to determine your Fake Football playstyle. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. Answer honestly!<br /><br />
    There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>

<h2>What are the eight values?</h2>
    <p>There are four independent axes - Playbook, Scouting, Aggression, and Memes - and each has two opposing values assigned to them. They are:</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#d32f2f;">Run</b> (Playbook)<br/>
        Those with higher Run scores are more likely to call running plays and prefer playbooks such as Pistol or Flexbone.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#00796b;">Pass</b> (Playbook)<br/>
        Those with higher Pass scores are more likely to call passing plays and prefer playbooks such as Spread or Air Raid.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#f57c00;">Scouter</b> (Scouting)<br/>
        Those with higher Scouter scores believe in the power of scouting. They most likely have a scouting sheet they consult rigorously, and view FCFB as a more skill based, methodical game of numbers.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#0288d1;">Guesser</b> (Scouting)<br/>
        Those with higher Guesser  scores don't believe as much in scouting. They tend to rarely check scouting sheets or not keep one at all, and view FCFB as a more emotional game of feeling.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#fbc02d;">Aggressive</b> (Aggression)<br/>
        Those with higher Aggression scores play more "all-or-nothing". They are more likely to go for touchdowns and go for two points or onside kicks.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#303f9f;">Passive</b> (Aggression)<br/>
        Those with higher passive scores are more likely to play for smaller, incrimental gains. They are more likely to punt or go for field goals on fourth down, and don't go for two points or onsides unless forced to.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#689f38;">Memer</b> (Memes)<br/>
        Those with higher Memer scores are more likely to call "meme" numbers, such as 1212 or 69. Memers are usually, but not always, more aggressive and encounter 0 and 750 diffs at a slightly higher rate.</p>
    <p class="value-description"><b style="color:#7b1fa2;">Anti-Memer</b> (Memes)<br/>
        Those with higher Anti-Memer scores tend to not play "meme" numbers as much. They sacrifice not as much 0 diffs on memes in exchange for less chance of getting 750 diffed.</p>
<h2>What's the "Closest Match" mean at the bottom of the results?</h2>
    <p>In addition to matching you to the eight values, the quiz also attempts to match you to a playstyle based on other famous FCFBers.</p>
<h2>I don't like my scores!</h2>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br/>
